#### A React web application that shall render a listing of cars up for sale along with image and details that are relevant to a car buyer (make, model, year, price, odometer reading, miles, detailed images etc.).

- Users are buyers in the market looking for more choices when it comes to buying cars (more choices than what a traditional non-online dealer would provide)

- Allows car purchasing from the confines of one’s home by providing accurate details of the vehicle including accident history, condition and clear external and internal images

- Website allows a car vendor to display his wares and complete transaction with interested parties (who are remotely located)

  

### Listing of user stories pertaining to `MVP` (mandatory) and `Non-MVP` (Additional Feature)` are listed below.
